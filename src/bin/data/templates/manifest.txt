# This is a simple MD5 manifest file for the contents of a ZanyBlue
# distribution.  The contents of the files in the distribution can
# be verified using the command (in the directory where the distribution
# was extracted):
#
#    $ md5sum --check {{ versioned_name }}/MANIFEST.txt
#
{% for entry in manifest %}{{ entry.md5sum }}  {{ entry.filename }}
{% endfor %}
