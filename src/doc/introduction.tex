\chapter{Introduction}

This manual describes the use of the ZanyBlue libraries, an Ada framework for
finite element analysis with supporting libraries of general use in other
projects.  The initial implementation contains the \texttt{Text}
package (and supporting packages and utilities) supplying functionality
mirroring the Java \texttt{MessageFormat} package.  Allowing the
application messages to be externalized in \texttt{.properties} files and
localized into additional languages.

Additional functionality is expected as the project progresses.
